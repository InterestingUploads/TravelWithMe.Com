The marriage of feudalism to freedom is the grandest of India's many paradoxes, and part of its magic and charm. India's people are utterly free, yet the situations of many are fixed in time, at roughly 100 years ago. Contradictions in everyday Indian life may leave you nonplussed on your first trip here. No matter how quickly it charges onto the information super-highway, India remains an enigma, a perplexity, and a puzzle you simply can't solve. And every time you think you know the place, something happens to jolt you out of your complacency.
<br><br>
The earliest remnants of an Indian civilization date from at least 3200 BC, and since then the subcontinent's culture and heritage have endured repeated invasions. Some say India's ability to adapt is the very source of her strength and resilience. Persian-influenced Mogul tombs add delicacy to urban skylines. British bungalows anchor Himalayan hill stations and line major avenues. Cuisines, languages, dance and music styles, and artwork and handicrafts vary widely from state to state. There's no American-style homogeneity in India; each region is intensely proud of its own culture.

TESTIMONIALS<br><br>
The Udaipur trip organised by Swan Tours , Delhi was awesome ! The vehicle , hotel and the other arrangements were exactly as promised.
<br>
Mrs. Seema Dhingra and family<br><br>
I highly recommend Swan Tours , New Delhi to organise a trip to India. The team at Swan Tours responded timely to our queries on emails and customised everything that we requested in our tour. From the moment we landed and were met by a smiling airport representative at the airport until the time we were taken back to the airport for our journey home, we felt amazingly safe ( heard some horror stories by tourists visiting India ). I appreciated having a private tour as we could adjust our...

The essence of contemporary Indian life is that people carry on with whatever activity pleases them, even if it's contrary to the law or the comfort of their neighbors—and neither the authorities or the bemused neighbors bat an eye. Parades of disgruntled workers with blaring micro-phones obstruct a city thoroughfare for 12 hours, and life goes on around them. Villagers use a highway running through their hamlet as a place to dry that season's rice crop, and truck drivers simply drop to the shoulder of the road, navigating care-fully for miles—even if it means landing in a ditch—to protect the grain. Your toddler irrigates the second-class train compartment you share with six other people, and your fellow passengers smile benignly and keep their feet up.</span>
